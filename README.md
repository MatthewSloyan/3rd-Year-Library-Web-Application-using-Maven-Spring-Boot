# Data Centric Web Applications 2 Project

This application was developed in my third year for Data Centric Web Applications 2. It is built using Apache Maven and Spring Boot and uses the controller/service/repository architecture. The application allows a logged in user to add, edit and remove books along with library users. All the data is stored on a MySQL database hosted using WAMP.
